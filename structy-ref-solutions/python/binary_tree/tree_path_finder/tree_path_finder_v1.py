    Finds a path from the root of the binary tree to a node with the target value using a recursive approach.

"""
Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the `path_finder` function is (O(n^2), where (n) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. 
This is because each recursive call involves unpacking a list of potentially up to (n) elements, resulting in O(n) 
time for each call. Since there can be up to n recursive calls in the worst-case scenario, the overall time complexity 
becomes O(n^2).

Space Complexity Analysis:
- Recursive function calls: O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree (worst-case scenario).
- Stack space for recursion: O(h).
Overall: O(h)

Further Notes:
This algorithm recursively searches for a path from the root of the binary tree to a node with a target value. 
It explores the left and right subtrees recursively until it finds the target node or exhausts all possible 
paths. The recursive approach leverages the natural structure of the binary tree, exploring each subtree 
until the target is found or all possible paths are explored. This approach ensures that the path returned 
is indeed from the root to the target node, as it explores all possible paths from the root down to the 
leaves. However, the unpacking of the list in the recursive function contributes to a time complexity of O(n^2). 
Therefore, caution should be exercised when using this algorithm, especially for large binary trees, as the time 
complexity can become prohibitively high.
