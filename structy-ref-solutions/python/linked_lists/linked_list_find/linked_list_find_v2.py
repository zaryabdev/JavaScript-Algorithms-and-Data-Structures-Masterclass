def linked_list_find(head, target):
    """
    Searches a linked list for a specific target value using recursion.

    Args:
        head (Node): The head node of the linked list.
        target (int): The value to search for in the linked list.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the target value is found, False otherwise.
    """

    if head is None:  # Base case: Empty list, target not found
        return False

    if head.val == target:  # Base case: Target found at the current node
        return True

    # Recursive case: Search for the target in the remaining list (head.next)
    return linked_list_find(head.next, target)

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# In the worst case, the recursive function calls itself for each node
# in the linked list until the target is found or the end is reached.
# This results in a linear time complexity proportional to the number of nodes (n).

# Space Complexity: O(n)
# Due to recursion, each function call creates a stack frame on the call stack.
# This stack frame stores information about the function call, local variables,
# and the return address. The depth of the call stack grows with the number of
# recursive calls, which can be up to n (number of nodes) in the worst case.
# This leads to a space complexity of O(n).

# Notes on Approach and Reasoning:
# This code implements a recursive approach to search for the target value.
# It checks for the base cases: an empty list (not found) or a match at the current node (found).
# Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the `head.next` node, effectively searching the remaining list.
# While concise, recursion can be less space-efficient for large linked lists
# due to the overhead of function calls and the call stack usage.
# For very large lists, an iterative approach might be preferable due to its constant space complexity.
