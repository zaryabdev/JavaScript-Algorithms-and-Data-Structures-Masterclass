## **Problem Statement** 

Given an `m×n` binary matrix, `mat`, find the distance from each cell to the nearest 0. The distance between two adjacent cells is 1. Cells to the left, right, above, and below the current cell will be considered adjacent.

### **Constraints**:

    1 ≤ mat.row , mat.col ≤ 50

    1 ≤ mat.row * mat.col ≤ 2500

    mat[i][j] ∈ {0,1}

    There is at least one 0 in mat.
