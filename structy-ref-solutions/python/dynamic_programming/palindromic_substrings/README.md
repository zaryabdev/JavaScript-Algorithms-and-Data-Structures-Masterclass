## **Problem Statement** 

Given a string, `s`, return the number of palindromic substrings contained in it. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string. A palindrome is a phrase, word, or sequence that reads the same forward and backward.

### **Constraints**:

    1 ≤ s.length ≤ 1000

    s consists of only lowercase English characters.

### Example

    s = “deed”

    Number of substrings = 10:
    “d”, “e”, “e”, “d”, “de”, “ee”, “ed”, “dee”, “eed”, and “deed”

    Out of these 10 substrings, 6 are palindromes:
    “d”, “e”, “e”, “d”, “ee”, and “deed”

    Therefore, the number of palindromic substrings in “deed” is 6.
