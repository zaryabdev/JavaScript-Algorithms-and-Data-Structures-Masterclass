# Time Complexity:
# The time complexity of this algorithm is approximately O(sw), where s is the length of the input string and w is the number of words.
# This is because for each character in the string, we potentially check all words in the list to see if the string starts with that word.

# Space Complexity:
# The space complexity is O(s) due to the memoization dictionary.
# We store the results for each unique remaining string, which can be up to the length of the input string.

# Notes:
# This algorithm uses a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently determine whether a string can be formed by concatenating words from a given list.
# We iterate through the list of words and check if the string starts with each word.
# If a match is found, we recursively check if the remaining suffix can be formed by concatenating words.
# We use memoization to avoid redundant computations and improve efficiency.
