# Time Complexity: O(n^2)
# The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the _max_palin_subsequence 
# function makes recursive calls for overlapping substrings. The number of recursive calls is proportional to the number of ways to choose 
# a starting and ending index for a substring within the original string. In the worst case, each substring is considered once, resulting in 
# n^2 time complexity.

# Space Complexity: O(n)
# The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n) due to the recursion call stack. In the worst case, the recursion can go up to n levels 
#(for a string of length n), leading to O(n) space complexity.

# Approach and Reasoning:
# This algorithm uses a recursive approach to solve the longest palindromic subsequence problem. It breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems of finding the longest palindromic subsequence in substrings. The core logic relies on the observation that if two characters at the starting and ending indexes of a substring are the same, then the longest palindromic subsequence of the entire substring can be formed by including those characters and finding the longest palindromic subsequence of the remaining substring (excluding those characters). Otherwise, the longest palindromic subsequence of the entire substring is the maximum of the longest palindromic subsequences obtained by excluding the character at either the starting or ending index.
