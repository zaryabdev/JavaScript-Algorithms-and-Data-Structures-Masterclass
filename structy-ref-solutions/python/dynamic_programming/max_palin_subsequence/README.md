# max palin subsequence

Write a function, `max_palin_subsequence`, that takes in a string as an argument. The function should return the length of the longest subsequence of the string that is also a palindrome.

A subsequence of a string can be created by deleting any characters of the string, while maintaining the relative order of characters.

```python
max_palin_subsequence("luwxult") # -> 5
```

```python
max_palin_subsequence("xyzaxxzy") # -> 6
```

```python
max_palin_subsequence("lol") # -> 3
```

```python
max_palin_subsequence("boabcdefop") # -> 3
```

```python
max_palin_subsequence("z") # -> 1
```

```python
max_palin_subsequence("chartreusepugvicefree") # -> 7
```

```python
max_palin_subsequence("qwueoiuahsdjnweuueueunasdnmnqweuzqwerty") # -> 15
```

```python
max_palin_subsequence("enamelpinportlandtildecoldpressedironyflannelsemioticsedisonbulbfashionaxe") # -> 31
```
