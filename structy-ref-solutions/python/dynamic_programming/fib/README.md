# fib

Write a function `fib` that takes in a number argument, **n**, and returns the n-th number of the Fibonacci sequence.

The 0-th number of the sequence is 0.

The 1-st number of the sequence is 1.

To generate further numbers of the sequence, calculate the sum of previous two numbers.



```python
fib(0); # -> 0
```


```python
fib(1); # -> 1
```


```python
fib(2); # -> 1
```


```python
fib(3); # -> 2
```


```python
fib(4); # -> 3
```


```python
fib(5); # -> 5
```


```python
fib(35); # -> 9227465
```


```python
fib(46); # -> 1836311903
```
