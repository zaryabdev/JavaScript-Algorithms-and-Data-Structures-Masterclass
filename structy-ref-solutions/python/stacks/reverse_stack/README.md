# Reverse Stack (Medium)

## **Problem Statement**

Given a stack represented by an array, implement a function `reverse_stack` that reverses the elements of the stack **in-place** using recursion.

### **Example**
Given an input stack which is a list of integers, implement the function `reverse_stack` that reverses the order of elements in this stack:

        Input = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        Expected output = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]



**Constraints**

* 0 <= `stack.length` <= 100
* -2^31 <= `stack[i]` <= 2^31 - 1

**Follow Up**

* Can you solve this problem iteratively? (This might have lower space complexity)
