Complexity Analysis
  - s: length of the input string
  - m: number of brace groups ('{abc}') in the string

Time Complexity: O((9^m) * s) in the worst case.  
In the worst case, each opening brace can be followed by any combination of the 9 digits (for repetition count) and other characters. 
This can lead to a branching factor of 9 for each opening brace. The stack operations (push and pop) take constant time (O(1)) on average. 
In the worst case, the stack might grow to a depth of m (number of brace pairs), leading to a total time complexity of O(m * 9^m) for processing 
the braces. Additionally, iterating through the string takes O(s) time. Combining these, the overall time complexity becomes O(m * 9^m) * O(s) = O((9^m) * s).

Space Complexity: O((9^m) * s) in the worst case.
Similar to the time complexity, the stack can grow to a depth of m (number of brace pairs) in the worst case. Each element in the stack can hold 
a string segment that could be the result of multiple repetitions within nested braces. The size of these string segments can grow exponentially 
based on the nesting depth and repetition counts. Therefore, the space complexity can be O(m * (9^m) * char_size), where char_size is the average 
size of a character in the string. In most cases, char_size is constant. Ignoring the constant factor, the space complexity becomes O((9^m) * s).

Additional Notes:
Note that the worst-case scenario for both time and space complexity occurs with specifically crafted strings containing nested braces and high repetition counts.
For most practical use the input strings are likely to have a limited number of braces and reasonable repetition counts. In such scenarios, the time and space complexity 
would be significantly lower. The actual complexity would depend on the specific characteristics of the input strings encountered in practice.

* The algorithm performs well for strings with a moderate number of braces and reasonable repetition factors.
* For extremely nested or highly repetitive strings, the exponential growth in stack size and processing time might become a concern.
