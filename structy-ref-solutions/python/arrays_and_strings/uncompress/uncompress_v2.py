def uncompress(s):
    """
    Decodes a compressed string based on a simple format.

    The compressed string uses the following format:
     - A character followed by a number represents the character repeated that many times.
     - If a character appears without a preceding number, it is repeated once.

    Args:
        s (str): The compressed string to be decompressed.

    Returns:
        str: The decompressed string, or -1 if the input string is empty.

# Time Complexity: O(n) in average case, O(n^2) in worst case
# The loop iterates through the compressed string (s) with a maximum of n iterations (n being the length of the string).
# Inside the loop, most operations are constant time (character checks, converting substrings to integers).
# However, string concatenation in the worst case (highly repetitive patterns) can lead to quadratic time complexity.
# In the average case, string concatenation might not be a significant factor, resulting in linear time complexity.

# Space Complexity: O(n)
# The `output` list grows as characters are appended during decompression, potentially reaching a size of n (where n is the length of the input string).
# There's also additional space usage for temporary variables like `i` and `j`.
# However, these temporary variables have a constant space complexity and don't significantly affect the overall space complexity dominated by the `output` list.

# Notes on Approach and Reasoning:
# This code implements a function to uncompress a string based on a simple format.
# It iterates through the compressed string and identifies sequences of characters followed by numbers.
# If a character appears without a number, it's assumed to be repeated once.
# The code extracts the number (if present) and appends the corresponding character to a list the specified number of times.
# Finally, the list elements are joined into a string to form the decompressed output.
# This approach efficiently decodes the compressed string in a single pass. However, it's important to consider the potential worst-case time complexity due to string concatenation.
