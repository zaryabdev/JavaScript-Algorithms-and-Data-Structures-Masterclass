def uncompress(s):
    """
    Decodes a compressed string based on a simple format.

    The compressed string uses the following format:
     - A character followed by a number represents the character repeated that many times.
     - If a character appears without a preceding number, it is repeated once.

    Args:
        s (str): The compressed string to be decompressed.

    Returns:
        str: The decompressed string, or -1 if the input string is empty.

# Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case
# The while loop iterates through the compressed string (s) with a maximum of n iterations (n being the length of the string).
# Inside the loop, operations like character checks and converting strings to integers are constant time.
# However, the string concatenation using `output += s[j] * number` can lead to quadratic time complexity in the worst case.
# As the loop iterates, the output string grows. Each concatenation operation involves copying the existing string content and then appending the new characters.
# In the worst case (highly repetitive compressed strings), these repeated concatenations become significant, leading to the overall time complexity approaching O(n^2).

# Space Complexity: O(n)
# In the worst case, the decompressed string can be significantly longer than the compressed string.
# The `output` string grows as characters are appended during decompression, potentially reaching a size of n (where n is the length of the input string).
# There's also additional space usage for temporary variables like `number` and `i`.
# However, these temporary variables have a constant space complexity and don't significantly affect the overall space complexity dominated by the `output` string.

# Notes on Approach and Reasoning:
# This code implements a function to uncompress a string based on a simple format.
# It iterates through the compressed string and identifies sequences of characters followed by numbers.
# If a character appears without a number, it's assumed to be repeated once.
# The code extracts the number (if present) and appends the corresponding character to the output string the specified number of times.
# This approach efficiently decodes the compressed string in a single pass.
